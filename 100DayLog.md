# 100 Days of ML Code
## Day 0: July 6, 2018
**Progress**: I sat down with my roomated, and we both worked on our projects for an hour (his wasn't related to 100 Days of ML Code). I found a dataset on Kaggle called PASSNYC. Their goal is to identify schools that need their help and increase representation of minorites in the SHSAT. I took some time to read through the discussons users were already having, and ended up getting 20 lines of code down. I followed Randy Lao's kernel. I had seen his work on LinkedIn, but never checked out his Kaggle account.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited. I'm not expecting to become a Kaggle grandmaster, or to win the PASSNYC competition, but I'm hopeful that I'll learn a lot - especially storytelling with data.
